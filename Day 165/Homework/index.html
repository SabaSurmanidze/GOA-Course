            <p>Have you ever wondered how a touch screen knows you are touching it? Well, it has these layers of transparent metal electrodes embedded in the display.</p>

            <p>When your finger gets close to the screen it causes a disturbance in the magnetic field that the electrodes sense.</p>

            <p>Because the electrodes are laid out on a grid, they can report back the x and y co-ordinates of the disturbance to the operating system. Pretty neat.</p>

            <p>Or maybe you’ve wondered why we call it a Gaussian blur. When we blur an image, we look at all the neighbouring pixels and multiply them by a matrix of weights called a kernel.</p>
