    <p>A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand 
deposit while simultaneously making loans.[1] Lending activities can be directly performed by 
the bank or indirectly through capital markets.[2]Whereas banks play an important role in financial 
stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over 
banks. Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional-reserve banking, under which
 banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities.[3] In addition to other
  regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements
   based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords.[4]Banking in its modern sense
    evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but, in many ways, 
    functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in
     the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties – notably,
      the Medicis, the Pazzi, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds 
      – have played a central role over many centuries. The oldest existing retail bank is
       Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472), while the oldest existing merchant
        bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590).</p>
